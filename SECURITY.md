- A brief description of the potential vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible, including any tools or scripts used.
- Any relevant logs or output.

Your responsible disclosure is greatly appreciated, and we'll strive to acknowledge your contribution.

## Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a security report, we will:

1. Confirm the issue and identify the affected versions.
2. Address the issue and prepare a new release.
3. Release the updated version and ensure all users are aware of the need to upgrade.
